"""

INTENT_USER_TEMPLATE = """# Input
User's question: "{query}"
Language: {language}

# Query history (context from previous queries in this session)

}}

# Lucene Query Syntax Guidelines
1. **Proper nouns/product names**: Preserve exactly and use quotation marks
   - Example: User input "Fess" → normalized_query: "Fess" (with quotes)
   - Example: User input "OpenSearch documentation" → "OpenSearch" AND "documentation"

2. **Title boosting**: For short queries (1-3 words), boost title matches
   - Example: "Fess" → title:"Fess"^2 OR "Fess"
   - Example: "security policy" → title:"security policy"^2 OR "security policy"

3. **Boolean operators**: Distinguish between required and optional terms
   - **Proper nouns/technical terms (required)**: Use + prefix for must-have conditions
     * Product names: Fess, Docker, OpenSearch, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, etc.
     * Technology names, company names, technical terms
     * Example: "Fess Docker tutorial" → +Fess +Docker (tutorial OR guide OR howto)
     * Example: "OpenSearch設定" → +OpenSearch (設定 OR configuration OR config)

   - **General terms (optional)**: Use OR grouping for flexible matching
     * Action words: 使い方, 方法, tutorial, guide, howto, setup, configuration, installation, etc.
     * Descriptive words: features, overview, introduction, capabilities, functionality, etc.
     * Example: "search engine features" → +(search AND engine) (features OR capabilities)

   - **Combining both**: Required terms + Optional terms with synonyms
     * Example: "FessのDockerの使い方" → +Fess +Docker (使い方 OR 方法 OR tutorial OR guide)
     * Example: "OpenSearch installation guide" → +OpenSearch (installation OR install OR setup) (guide OR tutorial OR howto)

4. **Phrase search**: Use quotation marks for multi-word phrases
   - Example: "how to configure" → "how to configure"

5. **General queries**: Keep natural language intent but optimize for search
   - Example: "What is the company policy?" → "company" AND "policy"

# Leveraging Query History for Context
When query history is available, use it to:
1. **Resolve ambiguous references**: If current query contains pronouns ("it", "that", "その"), map them to entities from previous queries
   - Example: History: ["Fess installation"] → Current: "How to configure it?" → Resolve "it" to "Fess"
2. **Maintain topic continuity**: If current query is a follow-up, incorporate context from previous queries
   - Example: History: ["Docker deployment"] → Current: "configuration file location" → Combine: +Docker (configuration OR config) (file OR location)
3. **Refine or drill down**: If current query is more specific than previous, combine both contexts
   - Example: History: ["search system"] → Current: "performance tuning" → Combine: +(search AND system) (performance OR tuning OR optimization)
4. **Expand abbreviations**: Use history to understand domain-specific abbreviations
   - Example: History: ["Fess Enterprise Search"] → Current: "FES setup" → Interpret "FES" as "Fess Enterprise Search"

# Output requirements
- **Output JSON only**.
- normalized_query: Generate Lucene-compatible query preserving proper nouns and using syntax features.
- **When history available**: Actively incorporate context to resolve ambiguities and improve query precision.
- **When no history**: Generate query based solely on current input.
- filters: Populate if inferrable (site/mimetype/date range); empty object if unknown.
- followups: Up to 3 brief clarifying questions if ambiguous.
